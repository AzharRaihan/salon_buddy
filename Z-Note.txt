These are my file.

Here Account Balance is a reference file  to understand Report Template structure.

Now I want to modify Account Statement below is my Account Statement Requirement.


Requirement Summary:

Requirement 1: In the Account Statement Report Payment Account Select is required, without Select Account data should not come.

Requirement 2: Add 2 column Opening balance, and last column closing balance

If I filtered date range eg: 2025-10-25 to 2025-12-25 then before start date all transaction will be calculated for opening balance. 
eg: current balance + sale ... and so on.



Follow Account Balance Template structure: eg: Report Header, Report Export Header, Summary Calculation.
Payment Account Name will be show bottom of the Generate By, Date Range will be how at top of the Generated On.
Show closing balance, Calculate Total Debit, Calculate Total Credit, and show in the table last row as like Account Balance.


Make sure all is working 100% correctly. so be careful.
